Feature: department admin can CRUD calendars

	As a 'Dept Admin'
	I want to CRUD calendars (name, google keys, etc) 
	So that I can manage our calendars.

Background: calenders have been added to the database

    |calender       |api-key | flag  |
    |calender1      |123     |public |

    And I am on the department_admin page

    And I fill in the following: "calender3" for "calendar","123" for "api-key","public" for "flag"

Scenario: able to read calendar
    When I follow "More about calender2"
    Then I should see the following: calendar2_detail,calender2,123,private #The google calendar,the calendar name, the api-key and the flag
